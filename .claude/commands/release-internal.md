# **Release**

**Arguments**: `{{arg1}}`
- First word: release type (patch, minor, major)
- If second word is "auto": skip approval prompts and automatically push to private repo

Prepare a release following this workflow:

## AUTO MODE DETECTION

If `{{arg1}}` contains "auto" (e.g., "patch auto"), run the entire process without stopping for approval:
1. Get commits since last release
2. Generate release notes (both developer and public versions)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Run `./scripts/release.sh [type]` (extract just patch/minor/major from arg1)
5. Push to private repo automatically
6. Show the public release notes at the end for reference
7. Provide link to GitHub Actions

Otherwise, follow the interactive workflow below:

## INTERNAL RELEASE WORKFLOW

1. **Get commits since last release**:
  - Find the last git tag: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
  - Get commits since that tag: `git log [last-tag]..HEAD --oneline`

2. **Generate release notes**:
  - Create TWO versions of release notes:

   **A. Developer CHANGELOG (for CHANGELOG.md)**:
  - Include all meaningful changes (features, fixes, improvements, refactors)
  - Can include internal changes (TypeScript fixes, optimizations, deprecations)
  - Technical language is fine
  - Categorize using: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed

   **B. Public Release Notes (for later use with /release-public)**:
  - ONLY user-facing changes that affect the user experience
  - Write in marketing/user-friendly language
  - Each bullet should answer "what can I now do?" or "what problem is fixed?"
  - Filter out ALL internal details:
    - NO code quality metrics (TypeScript errors, type improvements)
    - NO internal refactoring (component deprecations, architecture changes)
    - NO performance optimizations unless user-perceptible
    - NO developer tooling changes
  - Focus on tangible benefits:
    - New features users can try
    - Bugs that were annoying users
    - UI/UX improvements
  - Keep it brief and exciting
  - Use present tense ("Find and replace text in documents" not "Added find/replace")
  - No category headers needed for public notes

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
  - Add DEVELOPER CHANGELOG notes to the `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` (repository root)
  - Use the standard format with ### headings for each category
  - Only include categories that have changes

4. **Show BOTH versions to user**:
  - Display the developer CHANGELOG (what will go in CHANGELOG.md)
  - Display the PUBLIC release notes separately (for later use)
  - Ask for approval before proceeding

5. **Execute internal release** (after user approval):
  - Run `./scripts/release.sh [type]`
  - The script will:
    - Bump version in `packages/electron/package.json`
    - Update package-lock.json
    - Move [Unreleased] notes to a new versioned release section in CHANGELOG.md
    - Create commit with release notes
    - Create annotated git tag with release notes

6. **Push to private repo**:
  - Push main and tag: `git push origin main && git push origin v[VERSION]`
  - Provide link to GitHub Actions: https://github.com/nimbalyst/nimbalyst-code/actions

7. **Done**: Show the public release notes for reference when running `/release-public` later.

Valid release types: patch, minor, major
