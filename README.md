**Most of Us: A Civic Engine for American Policy Consensus**

Summary
Most of Us is a national platform that surfaces and amplifies the shared policy priorities of the American public. Built to transcend polarization, this project identifies the top 20 policy non-negotiables that unite 70–80% of Americans—on health, jobs, safety, dignity, and opportunity—and powers a public, transparent policy market where all residents can vote, refine, and elevate the ideas that matter most. This engine prepares the country for a modern, participatory, digitally secure democratic future.

Problem
Despite widespread agreement on core policies—from paid family leave to clean air—these issues remain gridlocked in government. Legislators often benefit from division, not consensus. Meanwhile, Americans lack a shared, easy-to-use tool to see, shape, and prioritize the issues that already unite them.

The Two Core Components

**1. America’s Shared Policy Platform**
A living, rank-ordered list of the Top 20 Policies Most Americans Agree On, such as:

* Make Housing Affordable
* Public option for healthcare access
* Paid parental leave
* $15 minimum wage indexed to inflation
* Universal pre-K and child care
* Clean energy investments
* Universal background checks for gun purchases
* End gerrymandering


Each policy is evaluated with:

* Public approval score (from national surveys)
* Estimated impact on lives (e.g., 100M+ affected)
* Budget effect (federal/state projections)
* A “Goodness Score” (equity, health, economic benefit)


This list will evolve via civic participation and expert modeling.

2. A Predictive Civic Market for Policy Consensus
A digital, secure, quarterly platform where Americans “vote” or “invest” in policies they believe in. This market:

* Allows everyone (residents, not just citizens) to participate
* Builds muscle memory for voting and collective decision-making
* Tests verified digital identity infrastructure
* Cultivates policy literacy and civic engagement
* Functions like a public prediction market, adjusted seasonally


This will be co-designed with voting rights orgs, behavioral economists, and tech platforms with a public-good mission.

Funding Use (Year 1)

* $1M
* National survey synthesis + Delphi panels
* Alpha launch of the policy voting/prediction tool
* Partnership building with civic groups, journalists, and technologists
* Pilot tests with 5 diverse communities



Why Now
We are approaching a constitutional and democratic inflection point. The public is disillusioned but aligned. Most of Us gives Americans a mirror and a megaphone—to see their shared priorities and to shape the next civic infrastructure. We can’t wait for elected officials. We must build it ourselves.
