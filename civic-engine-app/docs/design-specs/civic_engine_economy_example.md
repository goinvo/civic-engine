# Civic Engine: Problem Area Example

## Economic Opportunity & Wages

---

### Problem Statement

**The problem:** Wages for most American workers have stagnated for decades when adjusted for inflation, even as productivity and corporate profits have grown. Many full-time workers can't afford basic expenses. The link between "work hard and get ahead" and actual outcomes has weakened. Economic mobility — the chance that your kids do better than you — has declined.

**Why it matters:** Work is how most people support themselves and their families. When wages don't keep up with costs, people fall behind despite working. This erodes the social contract: if hard work doesn't lead to stability, why play by the rules? Economic anxiety fuels political instability.

**Where Americans agree:** Working people should be able to afford a decent life. The economy isn't working for everyone. Something is broken when full-time workers need food stamps.

**Where Americans disagree:** *Why* wages have stagnated — and *what* to do about it. Is it globalization, automation, weak unions, bad policy, or inevitable market forces? Should we raise wages directly, subsidize low earners, strengthen worker power, or focus on skills?

### Implementation Approaches

---

#### Approach 1: Raise the Minimum Wage

**Summary:** Increase the federal (or state/local) minimum wage so that low-wage work pays enough to live on. Current federal minimum: $7.25/hour (unchanged since 2009).

**How it works:**
- Federal minimum wage increase (proposals range from $12 to $17+)
- Phased in over several years
- Index to inflation (automatic increases)
- Some proposals: regional variation based on cost of living
- Some proposals: eliminate tipped minimum wage ($2.13 federal)

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Direct, immediate raise for low-wage workers | May reduce employment (economists debate magnitude) |
| Simple to implement and enforce | Small businesses in low-cost areas may struggle |
| Reduces government spending on safety net | Doesn't help unemployed or gig workers |
| Restores dignity to low-wage work | May accelerate automation of low-wage jobs |
| 30+ states already above federal minimum | One size may not fit all regions |

**Source:** Raise the Wage Act (federal $17 proposal); state minimums ranging from $7.25 to $17+; Seattle, NYC, CA examples

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Fast food worker (Destiny, 24)** | "I work 40 hours a week and qualify for food stamps. That's corporate welfare — taxpayers subsidize McDonald's payroll. Pay me enough to live." |
| **Small business owner (supportive)** | "I already pay $15 because that's what it takes to get reliable workers. A higher minimum levels the playing field against competitors who exploit people." |
| **Economist (progressive)** | "The Seattle and California natural experiments show minimal job losses. Monopsony power means employers can pay below market — minimum wage corrects that." |
| **Anti-poverty advocate** | "EITC is great, but it requires filing taxes and comes once a year. Minimum wage is immediate, every paycheck. Workers need both." |
| **Labor historian** | "The minimum wage was meant to be a living wage. FDR was explicit: 'No business which depends on paying less than living wages has any right to continue.'" |
| **Parent working two jobs (Luis, 38)** | "I work 60 hours between two jobs and barely see my kids. A real minimum wage means one job that supports a family. That's the American dream, right?" |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Economist (market-oriented)** | "Price floors create surpluses — in this case, unemployment. CBO estimates $15 minimum would eliminate 1.4 million jobs. Good intentions, bad outcomes." |
| **Small business owner (rural diner)** | "I operate on 5% margins. $15/hour isn't a raise — it's closing my doors. Seattle can afford it; my town in Mississippi can't." |
| **Teen job seeker (Jordan, 17)** | "I just want experience. If employers have to pay $15, they'll hire experienced adults, not teenagers. Entry-level jobs disappear." |
| **Restaurant owner** | "Eliminating the tipped minimum would destroy tipped workers' earnings. Good servers make $25-40/hour with tips. They don't want this 'help.'" |
| **Libertarian** | "Wages should be set by voluntary agreement between workers and employers. Government mandating prices is economically illiterate and morally wrong." |
| **Automation analyst** | "Every minimum wage increase accelerates the business case for kiosks, robots, and AI. You're not raising wages — you're eliminating the jobs entirely." |

**Evidence:**
- CBO (2021): $15 minimum would raise wages for 17 million workers; cost 1.4 million jobs; lift 900,000 out of poverty
- Seattle studies: UW study found hours reduced; Berkeley study found minimal impact. Depends on methodology.
- State variation: States with higher minimums haven't seen dramatic employment differences, but causality is disputed
- Historical: Real minimum wage peaked in 1968; current federal minimum is lowest in decades (inflation-adjusted)

---

#### Approach 2: Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

**Summary:** Boost the incomes of low-wage workers through a refundable tax credit that rewards work. The more you earn (up to a point), the bigger the credit.

**How it works:**
- Refundable credit: you get money even if you owe no taxes
- Phases in with earnings, plateaus, then phases out
- Current max: ~$7,400 for families with 3+ children; ~$600 for childless workers
- Proposals: Expand credit for childless workers, make monthly (not annual)
- Some proposals: match state EITC programs

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Rewards and incentivizes work | Comes once a year (hard to budget) |
| Doesn't burden employers (taxpayer-funded) | Complexity: many eligible workers don't claim |
| Bipartisan support (Reagan expansion, ongoing) | Doesn't raise market wages (may subsidize low-wage employers) |
| Targeted to low-income workers | High error/fraud rate due to complexity |
| Can adjust for family size, regional cost | Childless workers get almost nothing currently |

**Source:** Current federal EITC; LIFT Act and other expansion proposals; state EITC programs (30+ states)

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Conservative economist** | "EITC is the best anti-poverty program we have. It rewards work, doesn't distort markets, and has bipartisan support. Reagan expanded it; Clinton expanded it. Expand it again." |
| **Working mother (Shanice, 29)** | "That refund check every spring is how I catch up on bills and buy school clothes. It's not a handout — I earned it by working all year." |
| **Policy researcher** | "EITC lifted 5.6 million people out of poverty last year. It increases workforce participation, especially among single mothers. The evidence is rock solid." |
| **Anti-minimum-wage conservative** | "Instead of mandating wages that kill jobs, subsidize low-wage workers directly. EITC achieves the same goal without the economic damage." |
| **Tax simplification advocate** | "Make EITC automatic and monthly. The IRS has the data. No forms, no tax prep fees, no waiting until April. Just a steady boost every paycheck." |
| **Bipartisan deal-maker** | "This is where left and right actually agree. Expand EITC for childless workers, simplify claiming, make it monthly. It's achievable." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Labor advocate** | "EITC subsidizes Walmart's poverty wages with taxpayer money. Why should we pay so corporations can underpay? Raise wages instead." |
| **Childless worker (Marcus, 34)** | "I work full-time at $12/hour. My coworker with kids gets $5,000 in EITC; I get $200. How is that fair? We do the same job." |
| **Fraud-concerned taxpayer** | "EITC has a 25% improper payment rate — billions in fraud and errors. Fix the program before expanding it." |
| **Universal income advocate** | "EITC is complicated, stigmatizing, and requires work. Just give people money. Stop means-testing everything." |
| **Low-wage worker (annual complaint)** | "I need money every month, not a lump sum in April. By tax time I'm already in debt from the year. Monthly matters." |
| **Progressive critic** | "EITC lets employers off the hook. It's corporate welfare disguised as worker support. The public pays; employers profit." |

**Evidence:**
- Poverty impact: EITC lifts more children out of poverty than any other program except Social Security
- Work incentives: Strong evidence EITC increases labor force participation, especially single mothers
- Improper payments: ~25% rate, but mostly errors (complex eligibility), not fraud
- Claiming rate: ~80% of eligible workers claim; 20% leave money on the table
- Expansion proposals: Making childless worker credit equal to family credit would cost ~$100B/decade

#### Approach 3: Strengthen Labor Unions / Worker Power

**Summary:** Make it easier for workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. Restore worker power as a counterbalance to corporate power.

**How it works:**
- Easier union elections (card check, faster votes)
- Penalties for employer interference
- Sectoral bargaining (industry-wide contracts, not firm-by-firm)
- Ban "right-to-work" laws (which weaken union finances)
- Extend organizing rights to gig workers, contractors
- Worker representation on corporate boards (codetermination)

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Directly increases worker bargaining power | May reduce business flexibility and competitiveness |
| Union workers earn ~15% more than non-union | Can protect underperformers (rigid work rules) |
| Benefits extend beyond union members (pattern bargaining) | Adversarial labor relations in some industries |
| Political voice for working class | Union decline may be structural, not just legal |
| Reduces inequality (unions compress wage distribution) | Some workers don't want to pay dues or join |

**Source:** PRO Act (federal proposal); state-level reforms; international models (Germany codetermination, Nordic sectoral bargaining)

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Union electrician (Mike, 52)** | "My union negotiated my wages, benefits, pension, and safety standards. Without it, I'd be competing against guys willing to work for less. Solidarity works." |
| **Labor economist** | "The decline of unions explains a third of rising inequality since the 1970s. It's not coincidence that wages stagnated as union membership collapsed." |
| **Amazon warehouse worker** | "They monitor our bathroom breaks, fire people via algorithm, and pay poverty wages. Only collective action gives us any power. One worker is disposable; a thousand aren't." |
| **Progressive political strategist** | "Unions are the only mass organization that represents working-class interests in politics. Rebuild unions, rebuild democracy." |
| **German economist** | "Germany has strong unions, worker board representation, and higher manufacturing wages than the US — and they're still globally competitive. The American model isn't the only way." |
| **Service worker (hotel)** | "After we unionized, wages went up 30%, we got health insurance, and management couldn't schedule us with 2 hours notice anymore. That's dignity." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Small manufacturer** | "A union would make me uncompetitive. My margins are thin. I can't afford industry-wide contracts negotiated by mega-corporations and big unions." |
| **Worker who rejected union (Cynthia, 41)** | "We voted against unionizing. I don't want dues taken from my check to fund political causes I disagree with. Why can't progressives accept that some workers say no?" |
| **Economist (market-oriented)** | "Unions are cartels for labor. They benefit members at the expense of outsiders — consumers pay higher prices, non-union workers face less opportunity." |
| **Gig worker (freelancer by choice)** | "I left traditional employment deliberately. I don't want a union telling me when, where, and for how much I can work. Flexibility is the point." |
| **Right-to-work advocate** | "Forcing workers to pay dues to an organization they didn't choose is coercion. Right-to-work is about freedom of association." |
| **Business competitiveness analyst** | "Why did manufacturing move South, then overseas? Partly unions. Rigid work rules, adversarial relations, and high costs drove jobs away. That history matters." |

**Evidence:**
- Union wage premium: ~10-15% higher wages for comparable workers
- Inequality correlation: Union decline tracks closely with rising inequality since 1970s
- Membership decline: From 35% (1954) to 10% today (6% private sector)
- PRO Act provisions: Card check, sectoral bargaining, contractor reclassification — major structural changes
- International comparison: High-union countries (Germany, Scandinavia) have higher wages and lower inequality, but different industrial structures

#### Approach 4: Job Training & Skills Development

**Summary:** Help workers gain skills that command higher wages. Invest in education, apprenticeships, and retraining for the jobs of the future.

**How it works:**
- Expand apprenticeship programs (earn while you learn)
- Community college funding (free or subsidized)
- Sector-based training partnerships (employers + educators)
- Retraining programs for displaced workers (trade adjustment, automation transition)
- Pell Grant expansion for short-term credentials
- Tax credits for employer-provided training

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Addresses root cause (skills gap) | Takes years to show results |
| Empowers individuals long-term | Not everyone can or wants to retrain |
| Employer involvement ensures job relevance | Training programs have mixed track records |
| Doesn't mandate wages or interfere with markets | Doesn't help workers who already have skills but low wages |
| Bipartisan appeal (investment in people) | "Learn to code" can feel dismissive to displaced workers |

**Source:** Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA); German apprenticeship model; community college initiatives; sector partnerships

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Apprentice electrician (DeShawn, 23)** | "I'm earning while I'm learning. No student debt. In three years I'll be a journeyman making $35/hour. College isn't the only path." |
| **Community college president** | "We partner directly with employers who need skilled workers. Our students get credentials that lead to jobs, not just degrees that lead to debt." |
| **Conservative workforce advocate** | "Instead of mandating wages or expanding welfare, invest in people. Give them skills to command higher wages on merit. That's opportunity, not dependency." |
| **Tech company HR director** | "We can't find enough skilled workers. We'd happily pay more if candidates had the right training. The pipeline is the problem." |
| **Displaced manufacturing worker (Tom, 54)** | "I was skeptical, but the retraining program got me certified in HVAC. I'm earning more now than at the factory. It can work if it's done right." |
| **Economist (skills-focused)** | "The wage premium for education and skills has grown enormously. The best long-term anti-poverty program is investment in human capital." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Sociologist** | "The 'skills gap' is largely a myth promoted by employers who don't want to pay more. There's no shortage of workers — there's a shortage of decent wages." |
| **55-year-old displaced worker** | "'Learn to code' is an insult. I worked 30 years in manufacturing. I'm not going back to school to compete with 22-year-olds. I need wages for the skills I have." |
| **Job training program critic** | "Most federal job training programs have dismal outcomes. GAO has documented failure after failure. We keep funding what doesn't work." |
| **Low-wage worker (with degree)** | "I have a bachelor's degree and make $14/hour. It's not about skills — there just aren't enough good jobs. Training for bad jobs doesn't help." |
| **Labor advocate** | "Skills training puts all the burden on workers. What about employer responsibility? Why should workers constantly adapt while corporations extract profits?" |
| **Rural worker** | "Train for what jobs? There's nothing here. Training doesn't create jobs — it just makes you overqualified for the jobs that exist." |

**Evidence:**
- Apprenticeships: Strong outcomes; apprentices earn ~$300K more over career than peers. But programs are small in US compared to Germany.
- Community college: Mixed outcomes depending on program; vocational certificates often have better ROI than associate degrees
- Federal job training: GAO and academic reviews find modest positive effects, but high variation and many failures
- Skills gap debate: Employer surveys claim shortages; economists debate whether this reflects unwillingness to raise wages or train internally
- Automation displacement: McKinsey estimates 30% of workers need significant reskilling by 2030

#### Approach 5: Universal Basic Income (UBI)

**Summary:** Provide every adult a regular cash payment regardless of work status. Decouple basic economic security from employment.

**How it works:**
- Unconditional cash payment to all adults (proposals: $500-$1,000+/month)
- No means testing (everyone gets it) or work requirements
- Replaces or supplements existing safety net (varies by proposal)
- Funded through taxes (VAT, wealth tax, carbon tax, etc.)
- Some proposals: Negative Income Tax (similar mechanism, different structure)

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Eliminates poverty if set high enough | Extremely expensive ($3T+/year for $1K/month) |
| No bureaucracy, no stigma, no complexity | May reduce work incentives (debated) |
| Values unpaid work (caregiving, art, community) | Doesn't address employer power or wage determination |
| Cushion for gig economy, automation transition | Political feasibility very low |
| Freedom to refuse exploitative work | May cause inflation if not funded properly |

**Source:** Andrew Yang 2020 campaign ($1K/month "Freedom Dividend"); Alaska Permanent Fund (~$1,600/year); various pilot programs (Stockton, Kenya, Finland)

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Tech entrepreneur** | "Automation is coming for all jobs eventually. UBI is the only solution that doesn't depend on employment that may not exist. It's economic survival preparation." |
| **Caregiver (home, unpaid)** | "I take care of my disabled mother full-time. That's work, but it's not a 'job' so I get nothing. UBI recognizes that socially valuable work isn't always paid work." |
| **Libertarian economist** | "UBI replaces the entire welfare bureaucracy with one simple program. No case workers, no eligibility determination, no surveillance of the poor. It's freedom." |
| **Stockton pilot participant** | "That $500/month let me cut my second job and spend time with my kids. I didn't stop working — I stopped working myself to death." |
| **Artist (Kayla, 31)** | "I create things that matter but don't pay. UBI would let me contribute to culture without starving. The market doesn't value everything that's valuable." |
| **Anti-poverty progressive** | "Means-testing is expensive, intrusive, and misses people. Just give everyone money. Those who don't need it pay it back in taxes." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Fiscal conservative** | "$3 trillion a year. Where does that come from? Even confiscating all billionaire wealth wouldn't cover it. This is fantasy economics." |
| **Work-values conservative** | "Work isn't just about money — it's purpose, dignity, structure. UBI pays people not to work. That's corrosive to character and community." |
| **Safety-net defender** | "UBI proposals often replace existing programs. Trading food stamps, housing vouchers, and Medicaid for a $1,000 check hurts the poorest. It's a Trojan horse." |
| **Labor unionist** | "UBI is tech-bro distraction from the real fight: employer power, union rights, and living wages. Don't give people money to accept exploitation — fight the exploitation." |
| **Inflation-concerned economist** | "Give everyone $1,000/month and landlords raise rent $1,000/month. Without price controls, UBI just transfers wealth to asset owners." |
| **Job-creation advocate** | "People want to work. They want jobs. Instead of accepting mass unemployment and paying people off, create public jobs — infrastructure, caregiving, conservation." |

**Evidence:**
- Alaska Permanent Fund: ~$1,600/year; no significant work reduction; modest positive effects on health, education
- Stockton pilot: $500/month to 125 recipients; full-time employment increased (freed up time for job search)
- Finland experiment: No effect on employment; improved wellbeing, reduced stress
- Kenya GiveDirectly: Long-term cash transfers show sustained benefits, no work reduction
- Cost estimates: True UBI ($1K/month to all adults) would cost $3T+/year; partial versions much less

### What This Reveals

With this structure, you can see where "workers deserve more" consensus breaks down:

| Surface Agreement | Implementation Disagreement |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| "Working people should be able to afford a decent life" (85%+ agree) | Minimum wage: 60% support $15; 30% oppose |
| "The economy isn't working for everyone" (80%+ agree) | Unions: 65% favorable view; but 55% oppose mandatory dues |
| "Something is broken" (75%+ agree) | Government role: Mandate wages? Subsidize workers? Get out of the way? |
| | Root cause: Skills gap? Weak bargaining power? Bad policy? Globalization? |

**The deeper debates become visible:**

1. **What determines wages?** Productivity/skills (train workers) vs. bargaining power (strengthen unions) vs. policy choices (raise minimum)

2. **Who should act?** Government mandate (minimum wage) vs. government subsidy (EITC) vs. worker self-organization (unions) vs. individual effort (skills)

3. **Work itself:** Is work inherently good (work requirements, job creation) or just a means to income (UBI)?

4. **Employer responsibility:** Should employers pay living wages, or should taxpayers subsidize low wages?

These are genuinely different value frameworks, not just different policy preferences.

### Notes for Development

**Content Sourcing Strategy**
- Wage data: BLS, Economic Policy Institute, FRED
- Policy analysis: CBO scores, Urban Institute, AEI, Brookings
- International comparisons: OECD, ILO
- Pilot results: Academic evaluations (Stockton, Finland, Kenya)

**Neutrality Check**
Economic topics have strong ideological valence. Present market-skeptic and market-friendly views as genuine positions with coherent logic. "Libertarian" is not a slur; "socialist" is not a slur.

**Persona Diversity**
Each side includes:
- Workers in various situations (low-wage, union, displaced, gig)
- Economists (progressive, market-oriented)
- Employers (supportive and skeptical)
- Ideological voices (libertarian, progressive, conservative)
- People affected by specific policies (EITC recipients, union members, UBI pilot participants)
