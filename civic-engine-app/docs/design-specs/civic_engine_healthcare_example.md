## Healthcare Costs

---

### Problem Statement

**The problem:** Americans pay more for healthcare than any other developed nation — about $13,000 per person annually — yet have worse outcomes on many measures. Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy. Many people avoid care because of cost, ration medications, or stay in jobs they hate for insurance.

**Why it matters:** Healthcare costs affect every life decision — whether to start a business, change jobs, retire early, have children. A single serious illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings. The system's complexity means even insured people face surprise bills and coverage denials.

**Where Americans agree:** Healthcare costs too much. The system is confusing and frustrating. Something should change.

**Where Americans disagree:** *Why* it costs so much and *what* should change. The implementation approaches below reflect genuinely different theories of the problem — and different values about markets, government, and individual responsibility.

### Implementation Approaches

---

#### Approach 1: Single-Payer / Medicare for All

**Summary:** Replace private insurance with a single government-run program covering everyone. Eliminate premiums, deductibles, and copays. Fund through taxes.

**How it works:**
- Government becomes sole insurer (like Medicare, but for everyone)
- Private insurance eliminated for covered services
- Hospitals and doctors remain private but bill one payer
- Funded through progressive taxation (income, wealth, payroll)
- No out-of-pocket costs at point of service

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Universal coverage — no uninsured | Eliminates private insurance industry (~500K jobs) |
| Eliminates premiums, deductibles, copays | Significant tax increases required |
| Massive administrative savings (one payer, one set of rules) | Government controls what's covered |
| Bargaining power to lower drug/procedure prices | Transition disruption (people lose current plans) |
| Delinks insurance from employment | Potential wait times for non-urgent care |

**Source:** Medicare for All Act (Sanders/Jayapal); modeled on Canada, UK, Taiwan systems

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Primary care physician (Dr. Patel, 48)** | "I spend more time on billing than patients. My staff fights with 15 different insurers daily. One payer would let me practice medicine again." |
| **Cancer survivor (Linda, 56)** | "I had insurance. I still owe $40,000. My neighbor in Canada had the same cancer — she owes nothing. We're not a poor country. Why do we accept this?" |
| **Small business owner (Tom, 42)** | "I'd love to hire more people, but healthcare costs $800/month per employee. Medicare for All would let me compete with big companies who self-insure." |
| **Economist (progressive)** | "We already spend more public money per capita than countries with universal care. We're paying for a universal system and getting a fragmented one." |
| **Union organizer** | "Our members give up wages every contract negotiating healthcare. Take it off the table and we can fight for what matters — pay, conditions, dignity." |
| **Political philosopher** | "Healthcare is not a consumer good. When you're sick, you can't shop around. Markets fail for healthcare. This is what government is for." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Health insurance worker (Sharon, 51)** | "I've worked here 22 years. This isn't just a job — it's my career, my pension, my community. Half a million people like me just... eliminated?" |
| **Economist (market-oriented)** | "Single-payer eliminates price signals. Without competition, you get rationing, wait times, and no incentive for efficiency. Canada has nine-month waits for hip replacements." |
| **Taxpayer (middle-class)** | "My employer pays most of my premium now. Under Medicare for All, I pay through taxes instead. The math doesn't work out better for me." |
| **Medical device innovator** | "Price controls kill innovation. The US develops more new drugs than the rest of the world combined because there's profit in it. Eliminate that and we all lose." |
| **Libertarian** | "Government can't run the DMV well. You want them running all of healthcare? I should be able to buy whatever insurance I want — or none at all." |
| **Specialist physician (surgeon)** | "Medicare pays 80 cents on the dollar. If everyone's on Medicare rates, hospitals close, specialists retire. You'll have universal coverage and no one to see you." |

**Evidence:**
- Administrative costs: US ~34% of healthcare spending; Canada ~17%
- Per-capita spending: US ~$13,000; Canada ~$5,500; similar outcomes
- Transition studies (PERI, Political Economy Research Institute): Estimate net savings but acknowledge job displacement

#### Approach 2: Public Option

**Summary:** Create a government-run insurance plan that competes with private insurers. People can choose it or keep private coverage. Expand affordability subsidies.

**How it works:**
- Government offers a plan (like Medicare) on ACA exchanges
- Anyone can buy in; Medicaid-eligible auto-enrolled
- Private insurers continue operating, must compete on price/quality
- Premiums subsidized based on income
- Employer coverage continues

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Expands coverage without eliminating private insurance | Doesn't achieve universal coverage |
| Preserves choice (keep your plan if you like it) | Private insurers may "cream-skim" healthy patients |
| Creates competition that may lower prices | Government plan may be underfunded, offer limited networks |
| Politically more feasible | Doesn't fully address administrative complexity |
| Gradual transition, less disruption | Doesn't delink insurance from employment |

**Source:** Biden campaign proposal; various congressional bills; builds on ACA structure

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Moderate Democrat** | "Medicare for All isn't passing. This is what we can actually do. Perfect is the enemy of good — let's cover more people now." |
| **Self-employed consultant (Rachel, 38)** | "I just want a decent option I can afford. If I can buy into Medicare, great. If private is better, I'll choose that. Give me options." |
| **Health policy researcher** | "The public option tests whether government can compete. If it's better, it'll grow. If private insurers are really more efficient, they'll win. Let the market decide." |
| **ACA navigator** | "The exchanges work for people who qualify for subsidies. A public option fills the gap for people who make too much for subsidies but can't afford full-price plans." |
| **Union member (skeptical of M4A)** | "We fought hard for our health plan. Don't take it away. But a public option as backup? That makes sense — competition keeps everyone honest." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Progressive activist** | "The public option is a half-measure. It leaves the insurance industry in place, keeps the complexity, keeps the profit motive. Why compromise before the fight?" |
| **Insurance executive** | "A government plan doesn't need to make a profit and can underprice us unfairly. It's not competition — it's a slow path to single-payer through the back door." |
| **Hospital administrator** | "If the public option pays Medicare rates, we lose money on every patient. We'll have to cost-shift to private insurance, raising premiums for everyone else." |
| **Free-market economist** | "Government competing with private business is inherently unfair. The government can run losses forever. This crowds out private innovation." |
| **Rural hospital CEO** | "We're already barely surviving on Medicare rates. More patients at those rates means we close. There's already no hospital for 30 miles in some areas." |
| **Conservative** | "The public option is designed to fail private insurance and lead to single-payer. It's a Trojan horse. If you want Medicare for All, say so." |

**Evidence:**
- ACA marketplaces showed competition can lower premiums in some markets
- Medicare Advantage (private Medicare) suggests public-private competition is viable
- CBO estimates public option would cover 10-15 million more people

---

#### Approach 3: Price Regulation / Drug Negotiation

**Summary:** Let government negotiate drug prices. Regulate prices for procedures, hospital stays, and medical devices. Cap out-of-pocket costs.

**How it works:**
- Medicare negotiates directly with drug companies (currently prohibited)
- Reference pricing: tie US prices to international benchmarks
- All-payer rate setting: set standard prices everyone pays (like Maryland)
- Out-of-pocket caps for patients (insulin at $35/month, etc.)
- Surprise billing bans (already partially enacted)

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Directly addresses high prices without restructuring system | Doesn't address coverage gaps |
| Popular across party lines (especially drug negotiation) | Industry warns of reduced innovation investment |
| Works within existing public/private structure | Enforcement complexity (defining "fair" prices) |
| Immediate savings for patients and government | May reduce access if prices set too low |
| Surprise billing bans protect patients | Doesn't simplify administrative complexity |

**Source:** Inflation Reduction Act (partial drug negotiation); Maryland all-payer model; European reference pricing systems

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Diabetic patient (Marcus, 45)** | "Insulin costs $5 to make. I pay $300. The same vial costs $30 in Canada. This isn't a market — it's extortion because I'll die without it." |
| **Hospital CFO** | "We have no idea what anything costs because every insurer pays different rates. All-payer would let us actually budget, plan, and reduce administrative overhead." |
| **Economist (across spectrum)** | "Healthcare isn't a normal market — patients can't shop when they're in an ambulance. Price regulation is how every other country manages this." |
| **Fiscal conservative** | "Medicare is going bankrupt paying inflated prices. Negotiation isn't socialism — it's what any smart buyer does. Walmart negotiates. Why can't Medicare?" |
| **Primary care doctor** | "I can't tell patients what things cost because I don't know. Price transparency would let me help patients make real choices." |
| **AARP lobbyist** | "Seniors on fixed incomes choose between medications and food. Drug negotiation is common sense — 90% of Americans support it." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Pharmaceutical executive** | "It costs $2 billion to develop a new drug. Most fail. High prices on successes fund the R&D for everything else. Cut prices, cut cures." |
| **Biotech investor** | "I fund early-stage drug research. If the upside is capped by price controls, the investment math doesn't work. Capital will flow elsewhere." |
| **Free-market economist** | "Price controls create shortages. Always have, always will. You'll get lower prices and longer waits for drugs that exist, and fewer new drugs developed." |
| **Medical device startup founder** | "Reference pricing to Europe means we get European prices — which means European innovation levels. The US leads because we pay for it." |
| **Hospital in competitive market** | "We compete on quality and price. All-payer removes our ability to compete. The hospital down the road has worse outcomes but would get the same rates." |
| **Libertarian** | "Who decides what a 'fair' price is? Government bureaucrats? This is central planning. Let buyers and sellers negotiate freely." |

**Evidence:**
- VA (negotiates drug prices): pays 40% less than Medicare for same drugs
- Maryland (all-payer since 1970s): hospital cost growth slower than national average
- International comparison: US pays 2-3x more for same drugs as other developed nations

#### Approach 4: Market-Based Reforms

**Summary:** Increase competition, transparency, and consumer choice. Let people shop for care. Expand health savings accounts. Reduce regulations that limit competition.

**How it works:**
- Price transparency (hospitals must post prices)
- Expand HSAs (tax-advantaged savings for medical expenses)
- Allow insurance sales across state lines
- Reduce certificate-of-need laws (let more providers enter market)
- Direct primary care (monthly fee, no insurance middleman)
- Short-term and association health plans (more options, fewer mandates)

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Empowers consumers with information and choice | Most people can't "shop" for emergency or complex care |
| HSAs benefit those who can save | HSAs help wealthy more than poor (need money to save) |
| Competition may drive innovation and efficiency | "Skinny" plans may not cover serious illness |
| Reduces government role | Doesn't address pre-existing conditions without mandates |
| Appeals to those who distrust government solutions | Transparency alone hasn't lowered prices much so far |

**Source:** Republican health proposals; Heritage Foundation; direct primary care movement; price transparency executive orders

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Direct primary care physician (Dr. Chen, 39)** | "I charge $75/month. No insurance billing, no codes, no prior auth. I spend an hour with patients. This is what medicine should be." |
| **Healthy young person (Jake, 26)** | "I don't need a gold-plated plan. Let me buy catastrophic coverage cheap and put the rest in an HSA. Why is that illegal in most states?" |
| **Libertarian economist** | "Healthcare is expensive because it's the most regulated industry in America. Certificate-of-need laws literally make it illegal to open a new hospital. That's not a market." |
| **Small business owner** | "Association health plans let small businesses band together to get big-company rates. Why did the government kill those? We were finally getting affordable options." |
| **Medical tourist (Sarah, 52)** | "I got my hip replaced in Germany for $12,000. Same procedure here quoted at $50,000. Competition works — we just don't allow it in America." |
| **Health policy conservative** | "Every other market gets better and cheaper over time — phones, cars, TVs. Healthcare doesn't because it's not a real market. Fix that." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **ER physician (Dr. Rodriguez, 44)** | "No one comparison shops during a heart attack. Healthcare isn't like buying a TV. The 'consumer' model fundamentally misunderstands what we do." |
| **Cancer patient** | "I have a $10,000 deductible HSA plan. Then I got cancer. Now I'm bankrupt anyway. Cheap plans are fine until you actually get sick." |
| **Health policy researcher** | "We've had price transparency rules for years. Prices haven't dropped. Information asymmetry is too great — patients can't evaluate quality." |
| **Progressive advocate** | "Market-based reforms help the healthy and wealthy. If you're sick or poor, you're not a profitable customer. The market will never serve you." |
| **Nurse** | "Short-term plans don't cover pre-existing conditions, maternity, mental health. They're not real insurance. People buy them and discover they're unprotected." |
| **Health economist** | "Healthcare markets have fundamental failures: asymmetric information, principal-agent problems, unpredictable need, inability to comparison shop in emergencies. Markets alone can't fix this." |

**Evidence:**
- Price transparency: Limited impact so far; most patients don't shop even with information
- Direct primary care: High patient satisfaction, but serves small fraction of population
- HSAs: Benefit higher earners more; 80% of HSA assets held by top income quintile
- International: No developed nation relies primarily on market-based healthcare

#### Approach 5: Strengthen and Expand the ACA

**Summary:** Build on what exists. Expand subsidies, close coverage gaps, add enforcement, and incrementally improve the Affordable Care Act.

**How it works:**
- Increase premium subsidies (already done temporarily in 2021)
- Close Medicaid gap in non-expansion states
- Strengthen enforcement of ACA provisions
- Auto-enroll uninsured into coverage
- Improve navigator programs and outreach
- Reduce complexity of enrollment

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Builds on existing infrastructure | Preserves system that many find inadequate |
| Minimally disruptive | Doesn't address fundamental cost drivers |
| Politically achievable (already law) | Depends on ongoing political will and funding |
| Proven to reduce uninsured rate | Still leaves millions uninsured and underinsured |
| Protects pre-existing conditions | Administrative complexity remains |

**Source:** ACA enhancement bills; Biden administration executive actions; state-level ACA improvements

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **ACA marketplace user (Jessica, 34)** | "I have a pre-existing condition. Before the ACA, no one would insure me. The system isn't perfect, but it's why I have coverage. Protect and improve it." |
| **Pragmatic Democrat** | "We spent a decade getting the ACA passed and surviving repeal attempts. It's the foundation. Build on it rather than starting over with something that won't pass." |
| **State health official** | "The ACA framework lets states innovate. Colorado, Maryland, Nevada — we're experimenting with state options. Don't blow up the lab." |
| **Health policy incrementalist** | "Coverage expanded from 82% to 92% under the ACA. Medicaid expansion in remaining states would cover millions more. Finish what we started." |
| **Community health center administrator** | "Our funding comes through the ACA. Our patients — working poor, uninsured — depend on it. Revolutionary change risks everything we've built." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Medicare for All advocate** | "The ACA left 30 million uninsured and millions more underinsured. 'Strengthening' a broken system keeps the insurance companies in charge. It's not bold enough." |
| **Conservative** | "The ACA created mandates, regulations, and costs that drove up premiums. Doubling down makes it worse. Repeal and replace with real reform." |
| **Uninsured worker (Miguel, 29)** | "I make too much for Medicaid, too little for subsidies to make premiums affordable. The ACA doesn't help people in my situation." |
| **Self-employed person** | "ACA plans have $8,000 deductibles. I'm 'insured' but can't afford to use it. This isn't real coverage — it's catastrophic with a fancy name." |
| **Healthcare systems thinker** | "The ACA is a Rube Goldberg machine — subsidies, mandates, exchanges, Medicaid expansion — all to avoid the simple solution. Complexity is the problem." |
| **Libertarian** | "The individual mandate was unconstitutional government overreach. The ACA raised my premiums and limited my choices. Strengthening it means more of the same." |

**Evidence:**
- Uninsured rate dropped from 18% (2010) to 8% (2022) following ACA
- Medicaid expansion states: lower uninsured rates, better health outcomes, rural hospital survival
- Premium subsidy increases (2021): enrollment increased, premiums effectively lowered

### What This Reveals

With this structure, you can see where "healthcare costs are too high" consensus breaks down:

| Surface Agreement | Implementation Disagreement |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| "Healthcare costs too much" (85%+ agree) | Single-payer: 40% support, 40% oppose, 20% unsure |
| "The system is too complicated" (80%+ agree) | Market reforms: 35% support, 35% oppose, 30% unsure |
| "Prescription drugs are overpriced" (90%+ agree) | Government negotiation: 80% support (rare consensus!) |

**The real debates become visible:**

1. **Root cause theory:** Is it too much government (regulation, mandates) or too little (no bargaining power, no universal coverage)?

2. **Role of markets:** Can healthcare function as a market, or does it have inherent market failures?

3. **Disruption tolerance:** Incremental improvement vs. systemic transformation — how much chaos is acceptable for how much improvement?

4. **Who pays:** Taxes (everyone), premiums (individuals), employers, or cost controls (industry)?

These are genuinely different value frameworks, not just different policy preferences.
