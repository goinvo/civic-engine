# Civic Engine: Problem Area Example

## Housing Affordability

---

### Problem Statement

**The problem:** Housing costs have risen faster than wages for decades. Many Americans spend more than 30% of income on housing, limiting savings, economic mobility, and family stability. The median home price is now over 5x median household income nationally, and significantly higher in major metros.

**Why it matters:** Housing affects everything — commute times, school quality, family formation, wealth building, community stability. It's consistently ranked as a top concern across demographic groups.

**Where Americans agree:** Housing costs are too high. Something should be done.

**Where Americans disagree:** *What* should be done. The implementation approaches below represent genuinely different theories of the problem and different values about markets, government, and community.

### Implementation Approaches

---

#### Approach 1: Rent Stabilization

**Summary:** Limit how much landlords can raise rent each year, protecting current tenants from rapid price increases.

**How it works:**
- Cap annual rent increases (typically 3-8% or tied to inflation)
- Apply to buildings over a certain age or size
- Tenants can stay at predictable costs; resets to market rate when they leave

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Protects current tenants from displacement | May reduce housing supply if developers avoid building rental units |
| Provides stability for families, seniors, low-income renters | Landlords may reduce maintenance spending |
| Keeps communities intact | Benefits existing tenants, not people seeking housing |
| Immediate relief without government spending | Can create mismatch (large apartments held by empty-nesters) |

**Source:** Various state/local laws (NY, CA, OR); federal proposals modeled on existing programs

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Renter (Maria, 34, nurse)** | "My landlord raised rent 20% in one year. I'd been there six years. Rent control would have let me stay in my community near work instead of commuting 90 minutes." |
| **Community organizer** | "When longtime residents get priced out, neighborhoods lose their soul. The bodega owner, the church ladies, the guy who knows everyone — they're the community. Stability matters." |
| **Political philosopher** | "Housing is not a luxury good — it's a precondition for participating in society. The market's 'efficiency' means nothing if it produces mass displacement." |
| **Social worker** | "Every eviction I see cascades — kids change schools, parents lose jobs, mental health deteriorates. Keeping people housed is prevention, not charity." |
| **Labor union rep** | "Our members can't fight for better wages if they're one rent hike from homelessness. Housing stability is worker power." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Economist** | "The evidence is clear: rent control reduces housing supply long-term. You're helping today's tenants at the expense of tomorrow's. It's a transfer from future renters to current ones." |
| **Small landlord (James, 58, owns duplex)** | "I'm not a corporation. I have a mortgage, property taxes, maintenance costs. If I can't raise rent with costs, I'll sell to a developer who'll tear it down." |
| **Urban planner** | "Rent control treats symptoms, not causes. It doesn't create a single new unit. Meanwhile, developers avoid building rentals entirely — they go condo instead." |
| **Young renter seeking housing** | "Great for people who already have apartments. But I've been searching for six months. No one's moving, nothing's available, and what's listed is insanely expensive." |
| **Housing developer** | "Why would I build rental housing in a rent-controlled city? The math doesn't work. I'll build condos, or build somewhere else entirely." |

**Evidence:**
- Stanford study (Diamond et al. 2019): SF rent control reduced tenant displacement by 15%, but also reduced rental housing supply by 15%
- Mixed evidence overall: protects individuals, may worsen aggregate shortage

---

#### Approach 2: Zoning Reform / Build More Housing

**Summary:** Reduce regulatory barriers to building housing, especially near jobs and transit. Allow denser construction (apartments, duplexes, ADUs) in more areas.

**How it works:**
- Eliminate single-family-only zoning
- Reduce parking minimums
- Streamline permitting / approval processes
- Allow accessory dwelling units (ADUs) by right
- Upzone transit corridors and job centers

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Increases housing supply, which reduces prices over time | New construction may take years to affect prices |
| Creates construction jobs | Can change neighborhood character |
| No direct government spending required | New units often market-rate, not affordable |
| Addresses root cause (scarcity) | Existing homeowners may oppose (property values, traffic) |

**Source:** YIMBY movement; Minneapolis 2040 plan; Oregon HB 2001; CA SB 9/10; bipartisan state-level reforms

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Economist** | "This is Econ 101. Restrict supply, prices rise. We've made it illegal to build housing where people want to live. Of course it's expensive." |
| **Young professional (Alex, 28)** | "I make good money but can't afford to live near my job. My commute is two hours. Just let someone build an apartment building — I'll pay market rate, happily." |
| **Environmentalist** | "Single-family sprawl is an ecological disaster — longer commutes, more emissions, habitat destruction. Dense housing near transit is green housing." |
| **Libertarian philosopher** | "Property owners should be able to build what they want on their land. Zoning is government telling you what you can't do with property you own." |
| **Construction worker (Mike, 45)** | "More building means more work for my crew. And maybe my kids could actually afford to live in the town they grew up in." |
| **Civil rights advocate** | "Single-family zoning was designed to exclude. It's the polite version of redlining. Reform is a racial justice issue." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Longtime homeowner (Patricia, 67)** | "I moved here for the neighborhood — quiet streets, yards, good schools. Now they want to put apartment buildings next door? I have a right to protect what I invested in." |
| **Historic preservationist** | "These neighborhoods have architectural character worth protecting. Once you allow tear-downs for density, the history is gone forever." |
| **Progressive housing advocate** | "New market-rate housing doesn't help poor people — it helps developers. Without affordability requirements, upzoning is just gentrification with extra steps." |
| **Traffic engineer** | "Our infrastructure — roads, sewers, schools — was built for a certain density. You can't just triple the population without massive public investment." |
| **Small-town mayor** | "Our residents chose this community because it's not a city. Forcing urban density on suburban and rural areas isn't democracy, it's state overreach." |

**Evidence:**
- Tokyo (permissive zoning): Housing costs remained stable despite population growth
- Minneapolis (eliminated single-family zoning): Early data shows modest supply increase
- Broad economist consensus that supply constraints drive prices

---

#### Approach 3: Public/Social Housing

**Summary:** Government directly builds, owns, or finances housing that remains permanently affordable, not subject to market fluctuations.

**How it works:**
- Expand public housing construction (federal/state/local)
- Social housing models (mixed-income, self-financing)
- Community land trusts (public owns land, residents own buildings)
- Significant capital investment required upfront

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Permanently affordable (not temporary subsidy) | High upfront public investment |
| Decommodifies housing for residents | Historical stigma from poorly-maintained projects |
| Can be mixed-income, avoiding concentrated poverty | Government capacity/competence concerns |
| Long-term cost savings vs. ongoing subsidies | Long timeline to build at scale |

**Source:** Vienna social housing model; Montgomery County MD HOC; NYC NYCHA (cautionary); federal proposals (Homes Act)

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Political philosopher** | "Housing is too important to leave to markets that treat it as a speculative asset. Vienna has proven that public housing can be high-quality, mixed-income, and permanent." |
| **Public housing resident (Denise, 52)** | "I've lived in Montgomery County public housing for 15 years. It's well-maintained, my neighbors are teachers and nurses, and I'm not one rent hike from the street." |
| **Affordable housing developer** | "The math on affordable housing doesn't work without subsidy. Social housing removes the profit requirement entirely — that's the only way to serve people at the bottom." |
| **Urbanist** | "Every unit of social housing is a unit permanently removed from speculation. In 50 years, it'll still be affordable. No tax credit project can say that." |
| **Construction union leader** | "Public housing means union jobs building something that serves the public. That's the kind of work my members want to do." |
| **Fiscal analyst (long-term view)** | "We spend billions on vouchers every year, forever. Social housing has high upfront costs but pays for itself over decades. It's the fiscally responsible choice." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Fiscal conservative** | "We're talking about hundreds of billions in capital costs. Government already can't maintain the public housing it has. This is a fantasy." |
| **Economist** | "Government is terrible at being a landlord. Pruitt-Igoe, Cabrini-Green — the history is clear. Private management with public subsidy works better." |
| **Real estate developer** | "Government competing with private housing distorts the entire market. If public housing is subsidized, how can private builders compete?" |
| **Taxpayer (suburban)** | "Why should my taxes build housing in cities? I solved my housing problem by moving somewhere affordable. Others can do the same." |
| **Libertarian** | "Government has no business owning housing. This is a massive expansion of state power into people's private lives." |
| **Former public housing resident** | "I grew up in the projects. Don't romanticize it. Concentrated poverty, deferred maintenance, bureaucratic indifference. I got out as fast as I could." |

**Evidence:**
- Vienna: 60% of residents in subsidized housing; high quality, mixed-income
- Singapore: 80% in public housing; different governance context
- US history mixed: some successful (NYC Mitchell-Lama), some failures (high-rise projects)

#### Approach 4: Rental Assistance / Vouchers

**Summary:** Government subsidizes rent payments directly, helping low-income families afford market-rate housing.

**How it works:**
- Section 8 / Housing Choice Vouchers
- Tenant pays 30% of income; voucher covers the rest (up to a limit)
- Tenant can choose where to live (in theory)
- Administered by local housing authorities

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Immediate relief for recipients | Doesn't increase housing supply |
| Portable — recipient chooses location | Long waiting lists (often 2-10 years) |
| Integrates low-income families into various neighborhoods | Some landlords refuse to accept vouchers |
| Leverages existing housing stock | Can inflate rents if supply is constrained |

**Source:** HUD Housing Choice Voucher program; state/local rental assistance programs

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Policy researcher** | "Vouchers are the most evidence-backed housing intervention we have. Moving to Opportunity showed children's lives transformed by access to better neighborhoods. This works." |
| **Voucher recipient (Tanya, 41)** | "My voucher let me move my kids to a neighborhood with good schools. They're thriving now. That wouldn't have happened if we were stuck where we were." |
| **Economist** | "Vouchers let the market work while targeting help to those who need it. No government construction, no management overhead — just direct assistance." |
| **Anti-poverty advocate** | "Most eligible families get nothing because the program is underfunded. The solution isn't a different program — it's funding the one that works." |
| **Moderate politician** | "This is a market-based solution that helps poor families. It's the rare policy both parties can support — we just need the political will to fund it." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Fiscal conservative** | "It's a permanent spending commitment with no end in sight. We'll be paying landlords' mortgages with taxpayer money forever." |
| **Voucher holder frustrated (Derek, 38)** | "I have a voucher. You know how many landlords accept it? Almost none. It's been eight months. A voucher isn't housing — it's a piece of paper." |
| **Supply-side advocate** | "Vouchers don't create a single unit of housing. In a supply-constrained market, you're just bidding up prices for everyone else." |
| **Housing activist** | "Vouchers enrich landlords while keeping tenants insecure. The landlord can refuse to renew, can sell, can decide vouchers are too much hassle. It's not stability." |
| **Landlord (small)** | "The inspection requirements, the paperwork, the payment delays — it's a nightmare. I lost money every month I had a Section 8 tenant. Never again." |
| **Progressive** | "Why are we paying private landlords to house poor people? For the same money, we could build housing that stays affordable forever." |

**Evidence:**
- Moving to Opportunity study: Vouchers enabling moves to lower-poverty areas improved children's long-term outcomes
- Strong evidence vouchers reduce homelessness and housing instability
- Chronic underfunding means only 1 in 4 eligible households receives assistance

#### Approach 5: First-Time Buyer Assistance

**Summary:** Help people buy homes through down payment assistance, tax credits, or subsidized mortgages — building wealth through ownership.

**How it works:**
- Down payment assistance grants or loans
- First-time homebuyer tax credits
- Below-market mortgage rates for qualified buyers
- Shared equity programs (public entity co-invests)

**Tradeoffs:**

| Benefits | Costs |
|----------|-------|
| Builds household wealth | Can increase demand, raising prices further |
| Path to stability and community investment | Doesn't help renters who can't/won't buy |
| Addresses racial wealth gap (homeownership disparity) | Benefits those already close to buying |
| Popular across political spectrum | Subsidizes asset that may not appreciate |

**Source:** FHA programs; state housing finance agencies; Biden First-Time Homebuyer Credit proposal

**Voices in Support:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **First-generation buyer (Rosa, 29)** | "My parents rented their whole lives. They have nothing. The down payment assistance program is my shot at building something for my kids." |
| **Civil rights advocate** | "The Black-white wealth gap is largely a homeownership gap — caused by redlining, denied loans, stolen property. Down payment assistance is reparative." |
| **Real estate agent** | "Homeownership is how middle-class families build wealth. It's the American dream. We should help more people access it, not fewer." |
| **Financial advisor** | "A mortgage is forced savings. Renters pay someone else's mortgage. Even if home values were flat, owners build equity. Renters don't." |
| **Suburban parent** | "I want my kids to be able to buy a house someday. If they need help with a down payment, that's not a handout — it's giving them the same shot I had." |
| **Community banker** | "These programs bring qualified buyers to the table who just need help with the down payment. It's good for families, good for neighborhoods, good for lending." |

**Voices in Opposition:**

| Persona | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Economist** | "Subsidizing demand when supply is constrained just raises prices. Every dollar in down payment assistance gets capitalized into higher home values. You're subsidizing sellers." |
| **Renter by choice (Sam, 35)** | "Why does the government subsidize owning but not renting? I don't want to own — I want flexibility. But my taxes subsidize other people's mortgages." |
| **Urbanist** | "Homeownership subsidies encourage sprawl, car dependency, and resistance to new housing. Owners become NIMBYs. It's bad for cities." |
| **Millennial renter (Jaylen, 31)** | "A $10K down payment credit doesn't help me. Homes cost $600K here. This helps people who are already almost there — not people like me." |
| **Fiscal analyst** | "Between the mortgage interest deduction, capital gains exclusion, and these programs, we spend hundreds of billions subsidizing homeownership. Who benefits? Mostly the upper-middle class." |
| **Progressive housing advocate** | "Homeownership isn't wealth-building if you buy at the peak and the market crashes. Ask anyone who bought in 2006. We're pushing people into a risky asset." |

**Evidence:**
- Mixed: Subsidies can increase prices if supply constrained
- FHA historically important for middle-class wealth building
- Effectiveness depends heavily on local supply conditions

### Why This Works

| Old Approach (Policy Positions) | New Approach (Problem Areas + Implementations) |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| "Support rent control? Y/N" | Shows 5 approaches with explicit tradeoffs |
| False consensus (everyone agrees "housing should be affordable") | Surfaces where real disagreement lives |
| Hides values behind policy labels | Tradeoff dimensions reveal underlying values |
| Binary, flattening | Spectrum of support, nuanced |
| No action pathway | Phase 2 connects to candidates who share approach |
